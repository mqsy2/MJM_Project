2. Project Overview 
Project Title: 
“Curtain Call: The Automatic Curtain Opener” 
The Elevator Pitch (3-4 Sentences): 
“Curtain Call” is an automated curtain opening and closing device that allows you to simply 
open, close and adjust curtains for your windows with a button or prompt in your phone or 
even just let the AI do it for you.  
Problem Statement: 
The problem that we would be solving is the manual opening and closing of curtains for 
windows, if a home has a large number of windows in their house, it’d be more convenient for 
them to simply just press a button and close/open all of their window curtains at once or 
automatically.  
3. Technical Stack 
A. Hardware (The Embedded Side) 
● Microcontroller: Arduino Uno R4 WiFi 
● Inputs (Sensors): 
○ DHT11 
○ photoresistor 
○ XY160D motor driver module 
● Outputs (Actuators): 
○ 12v DC Motor with a curtain 
● Power Source: 
○ 12v DC adapter 
○ 12v female connector 
B. Software (The Web Side) 
● Frontend: Tailwind CSS / HTML / JavaScript 
● Backend: PHP 
● Database: MySQL 
● Hosting: Localhost (XAMPP/WAMP) 
C. Artificial Intelligence (The Brain) 
● AI Model: Google Gemini 1.5 Flash (via API) 
● AI Task: (Check one) 
○ [/ ] Generative: Converting text to hardware commands (Natural Language 
Processing). 
○ [ ] Classification: Deciding if data is "Good" or "Bad" (Sentiment Analysis). 
○ [ ] Summarization: Reading logs and explaining what happened. 
○ [ ] Expert System: Providing specific advice based on sensor data. 
● Sample Prompt: 
(Write the actual prompt you will send to the AI. Example: "Analyze this text: 
'$user_input'. Return a JSON object with 'color_hex' and 'motor_speed' based on the 
emotion.") 
 
4. System Logic (The Flow) 
(Explain step-by-step what happens when the user interacts with the system.) 
1. Input: User types "The sun is glaring on my screen" into the dashboard OR Sensor reads 
"Light Level: 950 (Direct Sunlight)". 
2. Processing: PHP combines this text and sensor data into a prompt and sends it to the 
Google Gemini API. 
3. AI Decision: The AI replies with a JSON command to CLOSE the curtains at full speed 
(255) to reduce the detected glare and heat. 
4. Storage: PHP saves this decision (Status: CLOSE, Speed: 255) to the MySQL table 
device_logs (or command_queue). 
5. Actuation: Arduino reads the database via WiFi and turns on the 12V DC Motor via the 
XY-160D driver to physically move the curtain.
